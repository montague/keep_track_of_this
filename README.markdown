the idea is to create a bookmarklet that injects a simple form into any webpage.

enter the subject, the "thing to remember" about that subject, and save it. 

later, hit the website to take a look at the stuff you've saved.

eventually, i'll introduce tags. and searching. also, it will do your taxes for you.
